# Microsoft-CSE-Project

Two folders backend and frontend.
Backend contains all Django python files. You can look at the views.py files to see the main logic for openAI calls. Frontend contains all react components for user interface and interactions. The frontend fetches the backend endpoints to get the responses from openAI.
